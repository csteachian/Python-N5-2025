# Task 3: Temperature Converter
# Write a program that:

# Stores a temperature in Celsius in a variable
# Converts it to Fahrenheit using the formula: F = (C Ã— 9/5) + 32
# Displays both temperatures with appropriate labels

tempC = 24.79
tempF = (tempC * 9/5) + 32
print("Temp C is "+str(tempC))
print("Temp F is "+str(tempF))
